# do-i-need-an-umbrella
A weather app that tells you if you need an umbrella. It also gives you information about what else to wear based on the weather. There's a raining theme and a sunny theme so try many places that are rainy and sunny!

A demo of this website built with Docker and deployed on Azure is here: https://doineedanumbrella.azurewebsites.net/

This app was made using React, TypeScript, the OpenWeather API, and a bit of help from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204C9yNeOYI
